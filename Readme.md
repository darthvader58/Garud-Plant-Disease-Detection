Garud 1.0 uses CNN to detect plantsâ€™ diseases. The CNN built for this purpose is a deep learning model with all the layers (except the output layer) using the ReLU activation function. The output layer uses the Softmax activation function. The entire model is designed on Python using keras and scikit learn modules along with the other essential modules. We used an epochs value of 25 for this model. To find anomalies in the agricultural field, we had planned to develop another neural network to analyse multispectral images of the field. However, no public datasets were available which suited our needs at the present time. Depending on the datasets, we can also change our approach using support vector machines in our ML model.
